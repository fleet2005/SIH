name of predictions(files under split_by_date) is very misleading, you need to change it, and tell it just shows how the heuristics change as days pass. It uses past heuristics + current data to generate the heuristics hence allowing us to customise the solution to choose how much we want to rely on prediction(past heuristics) and how much on realtime data (other params)
